# Introduction

The King County Housing Data Set contains information about the size, location, condition, and other features of houses in King County. A full description of the dataset's columns can be found below. The aim of this project is to develop a multiple regression model than can predict a house's price as accurately as possible.

### Column Names and descriptions for King County Data Set
* id - unique identified for a house
* dateDate - house was sold
* pricePrice - is prediction target
* bedroomsNumber - of Bedrooms/House
* bathroomsNumber - of bathrooms/bedrooms
* sqft_livingsquare - footage of the home
* sqft_lotsquare - footage of the lot
* floorsTotal - floors (levels) in house
* waterfront - House which has a view to a waterfront
* view - Has been viewed
* condition - How good the condition is ( Overall )
* grade - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system

* sqft_basement - square footage of the basement
* yr_built - Built Year
* yr_renovated - Year when house was renovated
* zipcode - zip
* lat - Latitude coordinate
* long - Longitude coordinate
* sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
* sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors


### Analysis Questions
This analysis will seek to answer three questions:

Q1: Which features are most highly correlated with price?
Q2: Which features have the strongest correlations with other predictor variables?
Q3: What combinations of features is the best fit, in terms of predictive power, for a multiple regression model to predict house prices?
